## Hi, I'm Shashank 👋

I’m a design-led builder exploring backend systems, product design, and creative technology.  
Recently I’ve been focused on learning by shipping real tools — experimenting with APIs, databases, and thoughtful UX.

### 🛠️ What I'm Working On

- ☕ **Coffee Tools** — a brewing tracker built with Node.js, Express, Drizzle ORM, and Postgres
- 🎨 Design-driven software experiments that combine storytelling + systems thinking
- Learning how ideas move from concept → prototype → deployed product

### 💻 Tech & Interests

- TypeScript / Node.js
- Backend architecture & APIs
- Postgres + data modelling
- UX thinking & product design
- Creative tooling & small useful software

---

### 📚 Currently Exploring

- Building full-stack systems from scratch
- How design and engineering influence each other
- Calm, human-centred software

> I like building things that feel honest, useful, and quietly well-designed.
